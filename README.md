- 👋 Hi, I’m @rsi-bstephenson, otherwise known as Brent Stephenson
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of fun and nerdy things including AI, Generative Text and Art, playing guitar, D&D, and video games, and Star Trek.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things Python and AWS related tools. Recently discovered AWS Lambda Powertools for .NET and figuring out how I can better use that in our current projects. Additionally, I'm finally learning my first Metallica songs on the guitar (I know tons on the bass, but I never tried learning them on a 6 string).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how we can improve our tooling and get away from being the cobbler's kids.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have 8 cats, and oddly enough, I still want more
